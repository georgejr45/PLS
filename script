# The dataset, originally collected at Cargill, includes 80 corn samples measured using three different NIR spectrometers. 
# Along with these measurements, the dataset contains the moisture, oil, protein, and starch values for each sample. 
# The 5th dataset, named 'm5spec', consists of NIR spectra for the 80 corn samples, all recorded on the same instrument. 
# Letâ€™s assign this NIR spectra data to X, add some additional information, and then plot it: %%.
